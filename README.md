# Ecommerce-customer-device-usage_LR : Overview

* There was a time mobile devices were primarily used for making telephone calls. Nowadays, mobile devices are ubiquitous and are used for a variety of purposes. From finding transportation to doing taxes, mobile app solutions have been growing at an exponential rate. One of the fastest growing mobile app verticals is eCommerce. In fact, eMarketer forecasts that the global eCommerce revenue will rise 19% in 2020 to $4.206 trillion (up from $3.535 trillion in 2019). By 2021, they expect global eCommerce revenue will approach $5 trillion. 

* As the Linear Regression project, I have implemented the best fit line by cross examine using MAE,MSE,RMSE
